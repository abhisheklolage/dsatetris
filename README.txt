DSA Mini-Project 2015-16
Name: Abhishek Lolage
MIS No.: 111408034

Tetris is a Russian tile-matching puzzle video game. 
The project was to make the game in the C programming language. 
The main tool used for displaying the gaming interface (GUI) was the ncurses library.
Using WINDOW, colors and attribute functions from ncurses, the board and the bricks were set. 

Bricks of various shapes fall from the sky onto the board. 
Using the arrow keys you have to place them in such a way that
when a row is full of blocks, it vanishes. 
The aim of the game is to survive..!

As the number of lines you clear increases, the speed of the falling bricks increases. 
You can use the shadow facility by pressing 's' to help yourself in your gameplay. 
To play fast, you can press SPACE to drop the brick. 
You can press 'p' to pause & unpause.
You can press 'q' or ESC to exit. 

Manage the falling bricks & survive..!

Thanks to C & ncurses.
Thanks to Prof. Abhijeet M for the supervision.
